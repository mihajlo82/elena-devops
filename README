🚀 DevOps CI/CD Case Study – Node.js Application

***OVERVIEW***

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application deployed on AWS EC2, using GitHub Actions, PM2, and Nginx.
It follows a branch-based deployment strategy with separate development and production environments, each exposed via its own domain.

The goal of this project is to showcase real-world DevOps practices, not just a tutorial setup.

Developer
   |
   |  git push (dev / main)
   v
GitHub Repository
   |
   |  GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
   |  - install dependencies
   |  - run tests
   |  - deploy via SSH
   v
AWS EC2 Instance
   |
   |-- /var/www/nodeapp-dev   (dev branch)
   |-- /var/www/nodeapp-prod  (main branch)
   |
   |-- PM2 process manager
   |-- Nginx reverse proxy



***Branch & Environment Strategy***

Git Branch    	Environment  	  Domain    	 Port   	    PM2 Process
-dev          Development    dev.abcde.com       3001           nodeapp-dev        
-main          Production      abcde.com         3000           nodeapp-prod

Each branch is automatically deployed to its corresponding environment.




***CI/CD Pipeline Overview***

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy code to an EC2 instance using PM2.

🚀 Trigger

➤ Runs on every push to:
➤ dev
➤ main


🧪 Continuous Integration (CI)

✔ Checkout the repository
✔ Install dependencies using npm ci
✔ Run automated tests with npm test
✔ Fail fast — deployment is skipped if tests fail



📦 Continuous Deployment (CD)

➜ Connects to the EC2 instance via SSH
➜ Detects the branch (dev or main)
➜ Deploys to the corresponding environment
➜ Pulls the latest code from GitHub
➜ Resets the working tree to a clean state
➜ Installs production dependencies
➜ Restarts the appropriate PM2 process
➜ Saves the PM2 process state for persistence


✅ Result

★ Fully automated deployments
★ Environment-aware (dev and main)
★ No manual SSH, git pull, or PM2 restarts required



*** 🛠 Technologies Used ***

➤ Node.js
➤ Git & GitHub
➤ GitHub Actions
➤ AWS EC2
➤ Nginx
➤ PM2
➤ Linux (Ubuntu)



*** 🔑 Key DevOps Practices Demonstrated ***

✔ Branch-based deployments
✔ Environment isolation (dev vs. prod)
✔ Automated testing before deployment
✔ Zero-downtime restarts with PM2
✔ Infrastructure accessed only via automation
✔ Production-safe deployment flow
